# scrape_dictionarydotcom
A python script that scrapes the entire English dictionary from dictionary.com

I would like to apologize to dictionary.com for doing this to them.

# Setup & Requirements
Made for python3.11

Ensure you have the required packages by running
```
python -m pip -r requirements.txt
```

# Running
Run the script via
```
python scrape_dictionary.py
```

This will take a while.

If you quit, it will not restart where it left off.

dictionary.json will be created with the scraped data

Please do not run this, it's for example purposes and documentation only. The resulting json has been provided on git.
